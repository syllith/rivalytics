### Discord Bot Commands (Overview)

The repository includes a Discord bot (see `/bot` directory) that provides quick in-channel summaries.

Key command notes:

* `!matches <username>` – Shows ranked history deltas plus ONLY recent **competitive** matches. As of latest changes, non-competitive / casual / custom / practice modes are excluded (no relaxed fallback). This ensures data reflects strictly ranked performance context.
* Filtering logic lives in `bot/utils.js` (`isCompetitiveMode`) and is intentionally strict: it matches explicit `competitive|ranked|tournament` modes and ignores `unknown|custom|practice|training`.
* If a user has zero recent competitive matches, the matches section will simply be omitted while ranked history still displays.

Future enhancements (ideas):
* Optional flag to relax filtering when fewer than N competitive matches exist.
* Pagination for more than 10 competitive matches.
* Per-match RS delta overlay if API exposes reliable mapping.
